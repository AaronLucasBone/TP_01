This project is an exploratory analysis of a Chess game dataset provided by Chess.com, the world’s most popular chess matchmaking sites. The games can range from beginner to grandmaster levels, contain various game types showing a wide variety of openings, and their miscalculations. The exploration portion of this report highlights varying correlations from variables like ‘total moves’, ‘long moves’, ‘inaccuracies’, ‘blunders’ (extremely bad moves that possibly flip the predicted winner), and ultimately the score. The Machine Learning portion of this report uses K Nearest Neighbor to properly estimate the winner of the game based solely off of these statistics without seeing the board at all.
